				<p class="summarytext">Driving this project was the mission to help alleviate strained relationships between children and their parents/grandparents resulting from the overuse of entertainment technologies. Children relying on these technologies tend to turn less to their elders as a source of entertainment and learning. We studied the real case of a grandfather, that as a ritual of empowerment for both himself and his grandson, writes short stories to his grandson. Choosing one of his stories, we designed a handwritten, interactive book that creates a playful and empowering storytelling adventure, requiring no technology to keep both parties engaged in the activity.</p>

				<p class="brieftext">Assigned in a discursive design research class, the aim of this assignment was to design a net-positive contribution to society through in depth research on a chosen complex social, political, or environmental issue. This net-positive contribution could range anywhere from the improvement and modification of an existing design that targets a specific issue, all the way to designing something completely new that offers a different approach to bringing the issue to light. Taking into account ethical design practice, the assignment required that we consider the entire lifecycle of the designed artifact.</p>

				<p class="researchtext">My team and I came across a special case study referred to us by a professor of a grandfather that writes short stories for his grandson, and how the storytelling ritual between this grandfather and his grandson allowed for a strong bond to be formed between both members of the activity. In addition, both members felt empowered by one another throughout and following the activity. It is with this case study that our team pursued research on relationships between children and their elders (more specifically, their grandparents) in this day and age, given the significant increase in technology use and the need for constant entertainment. We discovered that an over usage of technology by children often hindered the relationship with their elders, resulting in children rarely turning to their elders as a source of entertainment and learning. Inspired by this research, we decided to design a research-creation piece that would offer a positive way for both children and their elders to strengthen their relationship, in addition to empowering and entertaining each other without relying on technology.
				</p>

				<p class="finaltext">The final project consisted of taking one of the grandfather’s short stories from the case study we were inspired by, “Doctor Charlie and his Magic Foot”, and making it come alive through the design of a children’s book. We found the words in the story to be very expressive and decided to focus entirely on designing various typographic treatments, along with using creating watercolour paintings to elaborate certain moods and feelings. The story was handwritten and drawn by the members of the group, as we wanted to experience our involvement in the story’s design without the use of technology. The driving force behind the final design was the book’s interactivity, as it was capable of being folded outwards and inwards in various ways, along with having different ways of being read and interpreted. Finally, as a symbol of the storytelling ritual this grandfather had with this grandson, we produced a bookcase made from oak that had various texts from the other stories the grandfather had written, demonstrating that the project had a much broader meaning beyond this one short story.The final result: a playful and empowering adventure for anyone involved in the storytelling activity.
