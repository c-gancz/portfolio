			<p>Over the last few years, I have been working on numerous graphic design contracts requested from the household cleaning products company Vileda Canada. Vileda is a company that offers innovative cleaning products of all kinds, specializing in premium quality cleaning that offers long-lasting results. Working in conjunction with the marketing department, I have designed content for the company’s online marketing and social media accounts, and participated in many print-based projects such as product packaging.</p>

			<p>In 2015, I was approached by the company to redesign the existing Scrunge Scrub Sponges product packaging, and in turn, come up with new content for the promotional material they would be displaying on the web and in their print-based advertisements for the Scrunge line. Along with coming up new and improved packaging for the sponges,this project involved designing various freestanding newspaper inserts, magazine advertisements, email newsletters, and social media posts.</p>

				<p class="summarytext">Over the last few years, I have been working on numerous graphic design contracts requested from the household cleaning products company Vileda Canada. Vileda is a company that offers innovative cleaning products of all kinds, specializing in premium quality cleaning that offers long-lasting results. Working in conjunction with the marketing department, I have designed content for the company’s online marketing and social media accounts, and participated in many print-based projects such as product packaging.

In 2015, I was approached by the company to redesign the existing Scrunge Scrub Sponges product packaging, and in turn, come up with new content for the promotional material they would be displaying on the web and in their print-based advertisements for the Scrunge line. Along with coming up new and improved packaging for the sponges,this project involved designing various freestanding newspaper inserts, magazine advertisements, email newsletters, and social media posts.</p>

				<p class="brieftext">Taking into account modern graphic design trends and aesthetically-pleasing layout, I modified the existing product packaging by moving various elements around and increasing the size of the Vileda and Scrunge logos. I replaced the photographs with new ones that showed the environment where the sponge in question was most efficient in terms of cleaning. I removed the hands in the photographs and increased the photo of the sponge significantly, allowing for the sponge to be the central focus of the packaging design composition. Many of these photographs were edited to improve visual quality. Trying to remove clutter in the existing packaging, I designed a new “Extra Durable” icon that was more visually dynamic and took up less space in the layout.</p>

				<p class="finaltext">The numerous other design pieces I produced after the Scrunge packaging redesign project were inspired from the same techniques I used to improve the packaging. Included in these pieces was most notably a Homes and Cottages ad, a RedPlum newspaper insert, a web newsletter, and the production of a completely new packaging design for a Scrunge product that was launched in 2017 - The Glass Ceramic 12-Pack Scrunge set for Costco stores across Canada. </p>
