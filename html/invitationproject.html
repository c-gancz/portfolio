			<p>I was approached by a client who was getting married in October 2016 and wanted a custom designed wedding invitation set. The client wanted a piece that appeared crafty and handmade, all while maintaining elegance.

				<p class="summarytext">I was approached by a client who was getting married in October 2016 and wanted a custom designed wedding invitation set. The client wanted a piece that appeared crafty and handmade, all while maintaining elegance. She also specified the colours mulberry and rose gold as being predominant in her wedding theme, and wished for those colours to stand out in the wedding invitation. Crucial to the design was the need for the invitations to have an autumn-feel, as the wedding was taking place in the fall and the wedding decor would exemplify this season.</p>

				<p class="researchtext">The first step in the design of this invitation set was studying the colours mulberry and rose gold and finding specialty papers that would make these colours stand out. I then researched different ways of how I could make the invitation look handmade all while maintaining elegance, and came up with a portfolio-type invitation that could be folded out and included a pocket that held the reception and RSVP cards. Furthermore, I researched different ways I could promote the autumn season in this invitation set and found specialty scissors that could make a leafy design in paper while cutting through the sheet. I combined all of these elements together and came up with a final design that I then presented to the client.
</p>
				<p class="finaltext">The final design included a portfolio-style invitation set that was tied together with a rose gold ribbon and mulberry bow. For the invitation text, I chose a minimal serif typeface that complemented the various other elements that stood out in the invitation. I printed the text on white shimmer specialty paper, through a laser four colour process. Included was a leaf pattern on the cover and on the text prints, repeating the autumn theme throughout the whole set. Finally, each set included a vellum protective sheet that added a touch of elegance to the final design. Each invitation was completely handmade, including the sheet cutting and the production of the tying ribbons.</p>
