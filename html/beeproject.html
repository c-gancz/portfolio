			<p>In recent years, there has been a dramatic decline in pollinating-bee colonies worldwide resulting from toxic pesticides being ingested by bees during the pollination process. The mission of this project was to offer a positive way for people in Canada to make a difference, whether it was in the city or in the countryside. Inspired by the guerilla gardening movement, I produced seed bombs that when planted in just a small patch of soil, could grow bee-friendly pollinating plants local to specific parts of Canada. The project consisted of plantable seed bomb boxes, and a website that gave instructions on the gardening process so users can produce their own bee-friendly gardens.</p>

				<p class="summarytext">In recent years, there has been a dramatic decline in pollinating-bee colonies worldwide resulting from toxic pesticides being ingested by bees during the pollination process. The mission of this project was to offer a positive way for people in Canada to make a difference, whether it was in the city or in the countryside. Inspired by the guerilla gardening movement, I produced seed bombs that when planted in just a small patch of soil, could grow bee-friendly pollinating plants local to specific parts of Canada. The project consisted of plantable seed bomb boxes, and a website that gave instructions on the gardening process so users can produce their own bee-friendly gardens.</p>

				<p class="brieftext">The Canada Bee Conservation Project became the product of combining design work from two design classes at Concordia. The assignment guidelines for the Project Studio class was to design a project that elaborated design values that you hold dear, and culminate them into a final project. For the Web Design class, the instructions were to design a website that demonstrated/promoted social change and brought to light certain global issues.</p>

				<p class="researchtext">I began doing research on climate change and environmental issues and came across an alarming problem: The dramatic decline in pollinating bee colonies worldwide in recent years resulting from the lack of healthy plants for bees to pollinate. Trying to find ways to alleviate the situation, I became fascinated with the guerrilla gardening movement, which encourages people to grow plants everywhere- even in the smallest patches of soil. I thought: Why not make seed bombs containing seeds of bee-friendly plants that everyday people could grow in both city and countryside locations? Seed bombs are composed of compost (acts as the soil base to help the plant grow) and clay (biodegradable material that keeps the seed bomb intact until the planting process), making their planting process very easy! Gardening seemed to me the perfect fit for everyday people who want to make a difference in the complex issue of bee decline.
</p>
				<p class="finaltext">Focusing primarily on the issue of bee-decline in Canada, I decided to use the guerrilla gardening movement to alleviate some of the issues with this dramatic decline of bees in the country. I produced seed bombs made of bee-friendly, local Canadian seeds which would then grow into plants which bees could pollinate. I packaged these seed bombs in seed paper boxes which were decomposable and too could be planted in the ground. The project consisted of five different boxes: The West, The Yukon, The Prairies, The South, and the East, each holding seed bombs with seeds native to specific parts of Canada. As an addition, I designed a website that gave instructions on how to make seed bombs and how to garden them, as well as information on various plants that are native to Canada and great for bee-friendly gardens. Through interactivity and horizontal scrolling, users could navigate “across Canada” to access information.</p>
