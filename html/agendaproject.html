				</section>

				<p class="summarytext">This project stemmed from a special request given by a client who worked as an elementary school teacher and wanted a personalized agenda that met her organizational needs. Taking into account the sections she desired having, as well as personalized calendars and tabs that divided the agenda in various segments, I designed an agenda that was custom to her needs and aesthetic demands. Following this project, I was contacted by several teachers within the same school board who wished to have their own custom-designed agendas, and soon enough the word had spread across the city and I decided to make this project a small business that would open every summer to provide stationery services for teachers of all kinds.

The project began in the summer of 2014 and continues to this day, and every year the network of teachers interested in my services expands significantly. I realized that the main reason these services were so highly in demand was the result of the lack of existing agendas that accommodated the specific schedules and responsibilities each teacher has. The mission to continuously provide personalization in the design of these agendas became the driving force behind the success of this small entrepreneurship project.</p>

				<p class="brieftext">At first, I was outsourcing the production of these agendas to a third-party print company, until the demand became increasingly high and as a result, I decided to have the production in house and invest in my own printing equipment. This included various machines such as laser printers, a binding machine, and a heavy duty cutting machine. In 2016, I opened the online store for the first time and customers were able to personalize their agendas straight from the comfort of their own home. The user interface of the website allowed the users to build their own agendas, consisting of various addable sections, cover designs, and numerous organizational elements. I also began designing student agendas, and more sustainable agenda options such as the Plafree, which is an agenda that contains absolutely no plastic. In terms of the future of this small business, I plan to further research how I can personalize agendas to meet customer demands, and develop even more options for my customers to choose from whether it be used for the purposes of teaching, studying, or working.
